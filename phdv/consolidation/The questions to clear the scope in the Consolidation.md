Hi @

Tam and I joined Discovery Team last week and we think we need to catch up with the team to go forward. I'd like to list out all what we understand and what we need to catch up, to help you easily to give us your advices

**WHAT WE UNDERSTAND**

The scope in general of Consolidation Discovery
- To collect and document the information of all domains.
- To give the instructions for Service Domain Teams (Accounts, Hut, Menu, ect).
- To facilitate and connect all Service Domain Teams together to make the integration to be more efficent.

To do that, we defined some things need to done in general
1. Define Domain Boundaries
2. Sequence of Domains, with a rough time estimate per domain in “consolidation” mode
3. Definition of done for “consolidation” mode
4. Guiding principles for making decisions
5. Team composition (skillset) for each domain in “consolidation” and “operational” mode
6. Technical stack, language, databases, etc to be used for the target platform
7. Once sequence of domains is done, overlay that with the business priorities and decide how much technical debt and where we accept going forward

For me, I think this scope is doable steps. We also have the Kanban Board here: https://pizzahutinternational.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CD/boards/248.
The first time I see the board, I tried to look for the particular tasks for the steps above but I don't find anything from the board. It's quite general and needed to spread out more.

If there're something wrong, please help to correct.

**WHAT WE NEED TO CATCH UP**

Let's do a example with the first step in our scope:
Define Domain Boudaries => Outcome/Goals: Documented service domains and their boundaries, capabilities, exising integrations categorized into the service domains.

We would like to know

  - What do we need to do to reach the outcome? any paritcular task or action?
  - How long does it take to reach the outcome?
  - How do we know the Outcome "DONE"?
  - Once we complete "Define Domain Boudaries", have we have already defined the particular actions for next steps (Sequence of Domains, with a rough time estimate per domain in “consolidation” mode)?*

I assume that when Discovery team kicked off, we also defined the process, the way the team works. Could you help to clarify to me some points following?

- Who is the leader of this team?
- Which are the roles of all team members?
- Who is the person to defined the particular task or action for us to make the outcome done?
- Do we have any principle or guideline for the team members to follow?
- In case we have a blocker/issue, who is the contact person to help us for the advices?

I think this is the long-term team and some points above are clear for us to make the work to be more effeccient. If you have any concern, please let me know.

Thank you,

### Some more questions
The current team members cannot do the discovery, we need more people understand the domain involved in Discovery team. 
For the rough estimation per domain, discovery team doesn have enough knowledge to do that. Let service domain team does
If we still want do the estimation. just include all the experts from the Service Domain to Discovery team, they will help to
