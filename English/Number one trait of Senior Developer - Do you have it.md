## Transcript
- 00:00
- i think there's one specific trait that
- 00:02
- is most important in becoming a senior developer
- 00:05
- developer
- 00:06
- let me tell you what it is
- 00:13
- what's up everyone my name is james you
- 00:14
- quick and i do weekly videos on web
- 00:16
- development related topics and in this
- 00:19
- video we're going to talk a little bit
- 00:20
- about careers and what you need to do to
- 00:23
- become a senior developer and i became a
- 00:26
- senior developer when i was at fedex i
- 00:27
- became an architect so actually i went a
- 00:29
- level above that and i have a senior
- 00:31
- title now in my role at austiro
- 00:34
- and i've kind of spent some time
- 00:35
- reflecting on what does that actually
- 00:36
- mean a lot of people want to know how do
- 00:38
- i get to that next level how do i
- 00:39
- progress
- 00:40
- and it's really come down to one
- 00:42
- important thing but i want to start with
- 00:43
- a quote here and this is from amy knight
- 00:46
- and this is an interview she did
- 00:47
- on one of the microsoft channels i'll
- 00:49
- have a link to this the microsoft
- 00:50
- developer channel i'll link to this
- 00:51
- video below but she says at some point
- 00:54
- in her career she went from code that
- 00:56
- works to code that a team can use
- 01:00
- and this to me i think is the epitome of
- 01:02
- what i had come to think of as the
- 01:04
- number one trait so i'll tell you what
- 01:05
- that trait is
- 01:06
- that trait to me for a senior developer
- 01:08
- is to be able to turn a complex problem
- 01:12
- into smaller simpler ones
- 01:14
- breaking down that really tough kind of
- 01:16
- intimidating problem into some
- 01:19
- chunks that are manageable and
- 01:20
- understandable
- 01:22
- and i'll add one extra caveat to this so
- 01:24
- maybe it's two traits but i think it
- 01:26
- kind of goes in one it's being able to
- 01:28
- break down those complex problems and
- 01:30
- the smaller ones and then also
- 01:31
- communicate that when she said code that
- 01:33
- works to code that a team can use you
- 01:35
- have to be able to communicate you can't
- 01:37
- just be so smart and so sophisticated
- 01:40
- with the code that you write that people
- 01:41
- that are newer can't understand it you
- 01:43
- have to be able to communicate to that
- 01:45
- to your team as well
- 01:47
- and i want to tell you like i'll show
- 01:48
- you a code example of this in a second
- 01:50
- but i want to i want to tell you a story
- 01:52
- of when i started at fedex and when i
- 01:54
- started at fedex as my first full-time
- 01:57
- software development job i worked at
- 01:58
- microsoft for several years but didn't
- 02:00
- write code on a daily basis
- 02:02
- so i started fedex and i was trying to
- 02:04
- like kind of learn the source code of
- 02:05
- the project that i was looking in and i
- 02:07
- realized i was going like if i was
- 02:09
- trying to figure out one piece of
- 02:10
- functionality i was going from function
- 02:12
- call to function call to another class
- 02:15
- another file another function call
- 02:16
- another class another like 10 10
- 02:18
- function calls that were all chained
- 02:20
- together and i remember thinking like
- 02:22
- wow this is this is really intimidating
- 02:24
- there's a ton going on here
- 02:26
- but i didn't really appreciate at the
- 02:28
- time how well this solution was broken
- 02:31
- out it was broken into those many
- 02:32
- different files for a very specific
- 02:34
- reason and that reason was because these
- 02:37
- functions if you've heard this before
- 02:38
- these functions did one thing these
- 02:40
- classes had one responsibility and they
- 02:42
- were organized in a way that
- 02:44
- individually they made sense and now you
- 02:46
- just have to kind of piece them together
- 02:48
- and i look at like how that could have
- 02:50
- been a fairly
- 02:51
- complex problem and gotten to that point
- 02:53
- where it's broken out really well and
- 02:55
- and kind of another level of this is
- 02:58
- after a year or so
- 02:59
- we decided to rebuild an application
- 03:01
- from scratch and i remember thinking
- 03:03
- about this senior developer who was
- 03:05
- basically creating the majority of the
- 03:07
- code to start this thing out for us
- 03:10
- and he had he had his ideas of his
- 03:12
- classes his interfaces what
- 03:14
- functionality was going to go where
- 03:15
- because he was able to break that stuff
- 03:17
- down and then communicate that to us as
- 03:19
- well when we had questions
- 03:21
- now one of the interesting things for me
- 03:23
- kind of a turning point in my career was
- 03:25
- as i got more comfortable
- 03:27
- in my knowledge and the code base and
- 03:28
- things like that i started to kind of
- 03:30
- question things that were going on and i
- 03:32
- think that's really important not in a
- 03:33
- disrespectful way but being able to
- 03:35
- speak up ask those questions and also
- 03:37
- say hey why why is it this way instead
- 03:39
- of that way or wouldn't this other way
- 03:40
- have these other benefits and i think i
- 03:42
- earned a lot of respect for my team of
- 03:44
- not only being able to execute on what
- 03:46
- we are trying to do but also asking
- 03:47
- those questions and not being afraid to
- 03:50
- challenge people to say is this really
- 03:51
- the best thing or are there or are there
- 03:54
- alternative routes that we can go so
- 03:56
- that was a little bit of my experience
- 03:57
- at fedex of working with senior
- 03:59
- developers and then eventually becoming
- 04:00
- one myself again number one trait here
- 04:03
- is to turn a complex problem and to
- 04:05
- break it down into a bunch of smaller
- 04:07
- simpler ones that everyone can
- 04:08
- understand so let me show you a little
- 04:10
- bit of a piece of
- 04:12
- code a good example of the benefits of
- 04:14
- breaking down your code into smaller
- 04:16
- problems
- 04:17
- all right so i'm inside of what is
- 04:19
- actually the source code behind the
- 04:21
- compressed fm website so compressed fm
- 04:24
- is the podcast that i run with my
- 04:25
- co-host amy dutton and this is the uh
- 04:28
- the the code behind the website and i
- 04:30
- just wanted to show like how well broken
- 04:32
- out all of this stuff is because you
- 04:34
- look at there's tons of files in here
- 04:36
- right and this can be really
- 04:37
- intimidating especially as a new
- 04:39
- developer
- 04:40
- you join a project and there's there's
- 04:41
- hundreds of files maybe it's really hard
- 04:43
- to kind of uh internalize that and kind
- 04:45
- of understand it but i i think it was
- 04:47
- really important and this was this was a
- 04:49
- sign to me of how well done this stuff
- 04:51
- was of being able to break these things
- 04:53
- out into different
- 04:54
- places so if you start this is a next.js
- 04:56
- project it's not super important what it
- 04:58
- is uh but under pages we have uh all of
- 05:01
- our different individual pages and then
- 05:02
- some of these have like nested pages so
- 05:04
- it would be like slash dashboard slash
- 05:06
- guest slash sponsor that sort of stuff
- 05:08
- then we have our api this is our api
- 05:10
- routes
- 05:11
- and then we have our different modules
- 05:14
- so inside of like the about page for
- 05:16
- example here's the about page
- 05:18
- here are the different components that
- 05:20
- go with this about page and so i like
- 05:23
- how this is broken out into very clean
- 05:25
- modules where you have this page here as
- 05:26
- well now you'll notice if we go down
- 05:28
- back to the pages we also have an
- 05:30
- about.js here but the thing is that this
- 05:33
- thing will do kind of the queries so it
- 05:35
- will kind of specifically focus on the
- 05:37
- queries
- 05:38
- and then display a little bit of
- 05:40
- information but really what it displays
- 05:41
- is the actual about page itself so it
- 05:43
- grabs the information and then passes
- 05:45
- that information along to the about page
- 05:47
- now this is just kind of a random
- 05:49
- example
- 05:50
- but the opposite of that would be to
- 05:51
- throw all this code into one file and
- 05:53
- have it be really big and unclean and so
- 05:56
- she was able to break down and look at
- 05:57
- like here are the different things that
- 05:59
- we're gonna have break those into a nice
- 06:00
- folder structure for everyone to be able
- 06:02
- to follow and understand and then have
- 06:04
- this like separation of concerns of what
- 06:06
- components are doing what same thing
- 06:08
- same idea with functions functions
- 06:10
- should do one thing and you should split
- 06:12
- them out so that each one only does one
- 06:14
- thing
- 06:15
- so i think this is to me this is a sign
- 06:17
- of a senior developer being able to take
- 06:20
- like here's the bigger project that we
- 06:21
- want to have here's the product that we
- 06:23
- want to be able to build in the end
- 06:25
- what different components am i going to
- 06:27
- have and how do i break those out into
- 06:28
- ways that are really clean and easy to
- 06:30
- follow and that to me is a symbol of or
- 06:33
- is the number one symbol of a senior
- 06:35
- developer and going back to the quote
- 06:37
- from amy knight that we read at the
- 06:39
- beginning of this going from code that
- 06:41
- works to code that a team can use and
- 06:44
- being able to communicate that to the
- 06:46
- team i think is really important so that
- 06:47
- is my number one trait of a senior
- 06:49
- developer i'm curious what you think
- 06:51
- your number one trait would be of a
- 06:52
- senior developer let me know in the
- 06:54
